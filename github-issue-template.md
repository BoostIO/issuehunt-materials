## Labels
Labels are the best way to organize different types of issues. This makes switching easily, so new team members can learn the category at once.
Issues can have multiple labels as you want, and you can filter by one or many labels.

[Example](https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/labels)

## Mentions
By using @mentions and references inside of Issue, you can notify to other GitHub users. These provide a flexible way to get the right people involved to resolve issues effectively.
This works similar to how Twitter @mentions.

## References
Sometimes issues are dependent on other issues, so youâ€™d like to connect both. You can reference issues by typing hashtag + issue number.
